                    life on the whole.
                    Education is imparted to all, at various research and academic institutions, imparted by teachers,

                    knowledge,
                    skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.Education originated as

                    of
                    cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass
                    new
                    ideas
                    such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information, skills needed for the
                    modern
                    society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>
